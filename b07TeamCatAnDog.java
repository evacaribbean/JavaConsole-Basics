/*

With two different primitive variables (int and string) I had to "trix" a bit, as I donÂ´t know right now 
how to fully code in conjunction with system.in scanner. This sequence works swell.

You can try to mix and switch places between int and string. When I did so in some orders, the program 
"doublejumped". So the user can't fill in the following question. 

But I'll come back to this later on! :):)
