# Basic Java console practices ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

Hi!
This will be a repo with Java console practices that are the basics - first practices.<br>

It's fun to as soon as possible start "talking with" the prompt. So input/output will be the start. Then comes small practices and variations on the subject, followed by ...<br>

First out, a few input Java classes. Why not write a little Java program (Java source code) that the Java compiler (javac) will compile into bytecodes. For the Java's virtual machine (JVM) to execute. A code saying: <i>Hi, wazzup?!</i> ðŸ˜„.<br><br>

 âœ… b01Wazzup.java
 ```
 class b01Wazzup	 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {  

		System.out.println("Hi, wazzup?!"); 	
	}
} 
 ```
 <br>

 âœ… b02WazzupCls.java
 ```
class b02WazzupCls	 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {  

		System.out.println("Hi, wazzup?!");

		for (int i=0; i<60; i++)
    		System.out.println();
	}
} 
 ```
